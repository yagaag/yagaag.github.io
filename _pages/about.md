Welcome to my page! I'm a graduate Computer Science student at Arizona State University with 2 and half years of experience in building machine learning and data analytics systems. I'm skilled at implementation of production-ready ML and data APIs and libraries for web and iOS applications.

======
I'm passionate about Software Development, Backend Engineering, iOS Development and Machine Learning. 

I previously worked at Zoho Corporation, India as a software research and development engineer. I built computer vision features for multiple Zoho products (Zoho Writer, Zoho Notebooks, Zoho Show) and am skilled at building production-ready ML APIs and libraries for web and iOS platforms. 

Languages and Scripting : Python, Swift, JavaScript, Java, Scala, C++, CUDA, Shell, Git
Frameworks : Tensorflow, OpenCV, NodeJS, Django, FastAPI, CoreML, Vision (iOS)
Tools and Technologies : Jupyter, XCode, AWS Lambda, Amazon EMR, TravisCI, Tableau
Databases : MySQL, DynamoDB, MongoDB, BigQuery, AWS S3

I'm looking for Software Engineering internship opportunities for summer '23.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
